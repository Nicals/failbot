failbot plugins
===============

A failbot plugin command string is composed of 3 elements : a command
prefix string indicationg the message is a command, the name of a command
and several optionals args.

The default command prefix is '!', but it can be changed in the settings
file by assigning a string to the 'cmd prefix' key of settings dictionary.

Failbot plugins exists in several states. They can be loaded or not. A loaded
plugin is a plugin that is imported by python.

An loaded plugin can be enabled or disable. The name of those states are
quite obvious about their meanings.


failbot admin plugin
====================

The failbot admin plugin is intended to manage failbot itself and all its
plugins.

The available commands are : enable, disable, reset, load, unload, reload,
list, set, get and quit.

Managing failbot is fairly simple. The 'set' command can change on the fly
failbot current settings. The 'get' command prints the current value of a
given setting.
  
  < user > !get verbose
  < failbot > 4
  < user > !set verbose 2
  < failbot > user: done

Shuting down failbot is done with 'quit'.

The 'list' commands return the status of current loaded plugins. By default,
'list' gives all loaded plugins. An optional argument can be added to filter
plugins to print : 'enabled' or 'disabled'.

To enable or disable a plugin, 'enable' or 'disable' are the command to use
with the name of the plugin as argument.

A plugin may be reset to its initial state with the 'reset' command and the
plugin name as argument. Internaly, this call the init() function of the
plugin, so be sure to init your custom plugins in this function rather than
in the constructor.

The 'load' function is used to load a plugin. The first argument is the plugin's
name. By default, it came in a disabled state. This can be change by passing
'enable' or 'disable' as argument.

To unload a plugin, use 'unload' with the name of the plugin.

If you want to reload a plugin, you can use the above command or the 'reload'
one whiche will call 'unload' and 'load'. The first argument is the plugin
name, the second is the 'enable' or 'disable' argument for 'load'. This
command if you have change a plugin's code and want to apply the results.
